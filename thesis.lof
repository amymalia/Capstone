(b) shows how artificially increasing the resolution of the bathymetric grid from (a) using the duplication method of cell sub-division does not affect the bathymetric shadowing model but increases the number of cells to consider. (c) shows how artificially increasing the resolution using a smoothing function increased the number of cells to consider and can lead to inflated signal reception.\relax }}{18}{figure.caption.6}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces An illustration of how ray tracing and integration over a shape function can be used in Option 2 \& Option 3 to compute the probability of detecting fish within a cell. Dotted lines indicate the maximum and minimum depths visible to the receiver. The normal distributions in green/red indicate the distribution of fish within a given cell as determined by a shape function. The green portion of the curve indicates the observable section of the distribution, while the red indicates the unobservable section. The observable section (green) is computed by integration over the shape function. \relax }}{24}{figure.caption.8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.4}{\ignorespaces An illustration of how the critical slope, and $D_{max}$ are computed between cells $p$ and $q$. The slope between the receiver and all intervening cells are computed (blue and red arrows). Then, the greatest slope is selected as $m_{crit}$ (dark red arrow) because it poses the greatest obstruction to vision of cell $q$. Finally, $m_{crit}$ is projected into cell $q$ (the light red arrow) to determine $D_{max}$. \relax }}{26}{figure.caption.9}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.5}{\ignorespaces An illustration of the Exact Suppression Algorithm. (a) depicts a bathymetry grid with infinitely high walls (the white 'h' shape) on an otherwise flat plane (blue region). (b) depicts a Behavior Grid with a distribution (given by the OU movement model) of animals around the walls. (c) shows the computed Goodness of Receiver (receiver) locations within the study site. The program first identifies location 1 (the blue circle) as having the highest unique data recovery rate, and places a receiver there. The dotted lines represent the receiver's Detection Range. In (d), the program suppresses the Behavior Grid by subtracting the ERT of each cell within Suppression Range. Here the Suppression Range Factor is 1.0, so the Suppression Area is the same as the Detection Area. In (e), the Goodness Grid is recalculated, taking into account the suppressed Behavior Grid. Additionally, the program identifies location 2 as having the highest Unique Data Recovery Rate. In (f), the Behavior Grid is again suppressed to account for the placement of receiver (2). \relax }}{27}{figure.caption.10}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.6}{\ignorespaces An illustration of how ray tracing is used within a 3D environment to identify potential visual obstructions. Ray tracing is used to determine which cells potentially block the line of sight between the receiver-containing cell $p$, and the target cell $q$. Shaded cells must be evaluated by the Line of Sight algorithm to determine which portion of the water column in $q$ that is visible from $p$. \cite {Akbarzadeh2013}\relax }}{31}{figure.caption.11}
