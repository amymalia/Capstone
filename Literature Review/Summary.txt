Automated acoustic tracking of aquatic animals: scales, design
and deployment of listening station arrays
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Any aquatic species to which a
transmitter can be attached or implanted without modifying the behaviour of the animal is potentially suited to this
technology.

* Investigated gate/curtain and positional array setups

* Summary of issues: practical concerns, database, and analytical issues

* VR2 are cheap: 50 units for same price as 3-4

* The VR2 is a fully submerged receiver that continuously
monitors the environment for the presence of a unique, digitally coded transmitter signal (Lacroix and Voegeli 2000).
VR2 receivers are single-channel, omnidirectional units that
record the time, date and identity of animals fitted with
acoustic transmitters that swim within range of the unit
(Lacroix and Voegeli 2000; Voegeli et al. 2001)

**Advantages of acoustic arrays**
* active monitoring
	* labor intensive (limiting temporal windows)
	* must physically remain near animal
	* passive monitoring works when people arent/cant be there (safety)
	* vessel proximity can affect animal behavior
	* one focal individual representative of entire species
* acoustic array
	* high inital labor, but no maintenance
	* set and forget
	* natural behavior
	* can tag many individuals
	
* Important to identify study goals: 
	* home range vs migration routes
	* spatial scale
	* temporal scale: 
		* position -overlapping aray
		* residency - curtain/gate
		* presence/absence - gate/sparse array "fisheries setup"
		* long term survivorship? - only occasional pings necessary
	
* Human activity/use affect sensor setup and topology.
	* boats are noisy, probably need submerged bouys

* if you need high res positional data, use active tracking or radio linked monitoring systems
	* expensive, labor intensive, high maintenance
	* geographically limited <1km^2

* senosrs can provide indications of movements based on sequential detections.
* analytical process (weighted means) can increase positional accuracy

**Gates**
* fewer sensors than an array
* detects animals crossing the gate
* double curtain can give directional information
* distance between sensors is important as it affects detection %
	* missing a detection can lead to invalid conclusions about animal movement


**Rules of thumb**
* Flotation bouys block shadow cause acoustic shadow
* position in water column affects detection
* Fouling organisms are bad (barnacles, algae, hydroids)
* code collisions are bad
* noise is bad
	* animals make noise (shrimp, oysters, barnacles)
	* wave action and air bubbles are bad
	* areas of high flow
	* high levels of matter suspended in water
	* boats make noise
* bottom substrate is important
	* hard surfaces block/refelct shound
	* sand/mud will absorb it
* pincnoclines/thermoclines can cause refraction/reflection
* Attenuation caused by spreading and absorbtion by water
* attenuation @ 30db/km in fresh, 2db/km in salt
* 600m range in fresh, 800 in estuarine
* tl;dr: do field tests
	* cover temporal & situational discrepencies
		* day/night
		* seasonal
		* storm
		* wind
		* tidal changes
		* human activity

* range test hang transmitter off edge of boat, move away from sensor
