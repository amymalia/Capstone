1 Automated acoustic tracking of aquatic animals: scales, design
and deployment of listening station arrays
-----------------------------------------------------------
* Any aquatic species to which a transmitter can be attached or implanted without modifying the behaviour of the animal is potentially suited to this technology.

* Investigated gate/curtain and positional array setups

* Summary of issues: practical concerns, database, and analytical issues

* VR2 are cheap: 50 units for same price as 3-4 radio tags

* The VR2 is a fully submerged receiver that continuously
monitors the environment for the presence of a unique, digitally coded transmitter signal (Lacroix and Voegeli 2000).
VR2 receivers are single-channel, omnidirectional units that
record the time, date and identity of animals fitted with
acoustic transmitters that swim within range of the unit
(Lacroix and Voegeli 2000; Voegeli et al. 2001)

**Advantages of acoustic arrays**
* active monitoring
	* labor intensive (limiting temporal windows)
	* must physically remain near animal
	* passive monitoring works when people arent/cant be there (safety)
	* vessel proximity can affect animal behavior
	* one focal individual representative of entire species
* acoustic array
	* high inital labor, but no maintenance
	* set and forget
	* natural behavior
	* can tag many individuals
	
* Important to identify study goals: 
	* home range vs migration routes
	* spatial scale
	* temporal scale: 
		* position -overlapping aray
		* residency - curtain/gate
		* presence/absence - gate/sparse array "fisheries setup"
		* long term survivorship? - only occasional pings necessary
	
* Human activity/use affect sensor setup and topology.
	* boats are noisy, probably need submerged bouys

* if you need high res positional data, use active tracking or radio linked monitoring systems
	* expensive, labor intensive, high maintenance
	* geographically limited <1km^2

* senosrs can provide indications of movements based on sequential detections.
* analytical process (weighted means) can increase positional accuracy

**Gates**
* fewer sensors than an array
* detects animals crossing the gate
* double curtain can give directional information
* distance between sensors is important as it affects detection %
	* missing a detection can lead to invalid conclusions about animal movement


**Rules of thumb**
* Flotation bouys block shadow cause acoustic shadow
* position in water column affects detection
* Fouling organisms are bad (barnacles, algae, hydroids)
* code collisions are bad
* noise is bad
	* animals make noise (shrimp, oysters, barnacles)
	* wave action and air bubbles are bad
	* areas of high flow
	* high levels of matter suspended in water
	* boats make noise
* bottom substrate is important
	* hard surfaces block/refelct shound
	* sand/mud will absorb it
* pincnoclines/thermoclines can cause refraction/reflection
* Attenuation caused by spreading and absorbtion by water
* attenuation @ 30db/km in fresh, 2db/km in salt
* 600m range in fresh, 800 in estuarine
* tl;dr: do field tests
	* cover temporal & situational discrepencies
		* day/night
		* seasonal
		* storm
		* wind
		* tidal changes
		* human activity

* range test hang transmitter off edge of boat, move away from sensor

2 Constrained Coverage for Mobile Sensor Networks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Discover network configuration to maximize network coverage, while maintaining k neighbors
* Used point force simulation:
	* each node exerts a pushing force on other nodes to maximize coverage
	* each node is attracted strongly attracted to othernodes if it has less than K neighbors.
	* balancing these forces results in optimal k-neighbor coverage
* sensors capable of omnidirectional movement
* sensors had knowledge of neighbors

3 Performance of an ultrasonic telemetry positioning system under varied environmental conditions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Comparing x/y pos of tags determined by GPS and VPS
	* "Horizontal Positional Error" (HPEm) = euclidian dist between VPS and GPS
	* "Positional Efficiecny" % of pings captured
	* Study sites @ Estuary, River, Coast
* Geometry of sensor array determined by "viewing angle"
	* viewing angle = degree of vision required to view entire array from one sensors perspective.
	* wide angle means sensor is in the middle, narrow means at edges
	* Test configurations varied between 127 deg @ river and 242 @ Costal
	* wider angles have smaller HPEms
	* wider angles have smaller positional efficcientcy
		* more detections at edge of array
			* unkown reason for low detections
				*50m for costal/ravine
				* 200-300 m for estuary

* DO FIELD TESTS

* avoid potential signal blockers (giant kelp)

* General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) indicate that array geometry was consistently the most important predictor of positioning performance. 

* Environmental noise and water movement also emerged as additional predictors of performance at several sites

* Importance of testing array geometries. 
* Water quality parameters should be monitored and receiver mooring designs should be considered

* The quality and efficiency of positioning by telemetry systems relies upon variables controlled by the researcher as well as upon environmental conditions

* User controlled variables:
	* sensor topology
	* speed of sound at site
	* mooring design
* Environmental variables can block and mask acousitc signals

4 Fast Sensor Placement Algorithms for Fusion-based Target Detection
------------------------------------------------------------------
* Goal was to "Cover" target "surveilance spots"

* Define "coverage" as function of probability of detection (Pd) and probablilty of false positive (Pf).

* Constraint: Use the fewest possible # of sensors to achieve coverage.

* Exponential big O

* Suggest using divide and conquer, fiding local solution for each surveilance spot, then combining for a global solution.  Polynoimal time, but inefficcient global solution.

* Suggest alternate divide and conquer, where sensor count is minimized by choosing spots that cover multiple spots until those spots are covered, then add sensors until other spots are covered.
	* Enables "reuse" of previous solutions.  Building solution
	* Individual sensors become less useful as tehy are streched to cover more points.
	* Can result in multiple sensors overlaped to achieve coverage.

* Clustering algorithm improved runtime and reduced num sensors reqd by clustering geographically close surveilence spots and solving for indivudal clusters.

** Possible to implement this algorithim within our framework by utilizing behavior location to define "surveilence locations".  Use high projected sensor count to see how sensor count/coverage are correlated.

5 Probabilistic Sensing Model for Sensor Placement Optimization Based on Line-of-Sight Coverage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Context: Wireless sensor networks - small inexpensive sensor devices, with limited sensing, storage, processing, communication.

* 4 main considerations: Performance, reliability, engergy saving, cost minimization.

* Requirement: Cover all areas of interest, sometimes sensor overlap is required, sometimes one sensor is ok.

* Deterministic methods assume omnidirectional disk sensing models, which ignore terrain allow for deterministic solutions. As a result, theoretical coverage is overestimated in practice.

* Antennas and microphones have non uniform 3-D reception fields that depend on factors like orientation, dist, and env factors.

* Coverage is not binary, but probabilistic.

* Sensor height is important -> 3d space

* Fig 2 & 3 show LOS

** In 3d space, a lattice might not be a flat layer.  Optimal layout probably won't be flat

* Example of video surveilence coverage of urban environment

6 Close proximity detection interference with acoustic telemetry: the importance of considering tag power output in low ambient noise environments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Bigger tags can be more powerful.  
* Tags size limited by animal size.  
* Misconception: Stronger signal = better.
* High tag power = stronger CPDI
* Losses caused by spreading, reflection, scattering, absorption, refraction.
* "Donut effect": Short range signals don't get registered.
* Close Proximity Detection Interference (CPDI)
* Most people concerned with max distance, not min dist.
* Investigate CPDI in 3 environments to assess CPDI effect
* Wind decreases CPDI as it makes noise + the surface irregular and so less reflection
* Cumberland sound, Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada: 
	* CPDI observed for two high powered tags: 
		V16-6H tag
		8.3% @ 55m, 
		88.8% @ 370m

		V13-2H tag
		17.9% @ 55m
		88.4@ 221m

	* 30 m depth, hard seafloor
	* sensors 5m off seafloor
	* 8 VR2W 69 kHz acoustic receivers at varying distances form sensor


* Lake Charlotte, Nova Scotia, Canada:
	* More pings than expected
		* due to signal reflection off surface + hard bottom
		* periods of high wind distrupt reflections
	* 40m depth, soft mud bottom
	* 3m off seafloor

* Jupiter, Florida, USA
	* reef, lots of human activity, consistent currents	
	* 20m depth, 1.5m of sand over hard reef
	* 2m off seafloor
	* Lower CPDI 
		* site is windy + exposed = irregular surface and so no reflection
		* Boat noise drowns out echos
		* Reef animals (fauna) make noise
		* Sand absorbed reflections
	* Background noise lowered CPDI, but decreased detection range
		
7 The value of Information in Fishery Management
--------------------------------------------------
* Researchers advocate for more money to spend on information gathering
* Those resources could be spent on actual management
* Information gathering reduces uncertainty
	* resonable to assume diminishing returns on goodness of decision
* Collect the optimal ammount of information
* Finite research budgets mean money spent on one thing is less spent on another
	* opportunity cost
* Sea lampreys
	* $15m annual budget
	* assessing which streams should be treated accounts for 30% of $ alloted for treatment
	* used cheaper "adaptive management approach
	* more killed since more spent on treatment
	* less accurate assessment of how many are killed
* Estimated cost of global network of MPAs sufficcient for biodiversity protection and fisheries sustainability estimated at $5-19B USD.  
* Gathering information is expensive
* It is belieived that MPAs will be more effective if places are carefully chosen.
* No consensus on "optimal" configuration
	* Beleived that many alternative configurations will emerge as "optimal"
		* indicates that configurations may be only slightly impacted by sub-optimal
		* obviously there are still "bad" designs
* Exists resarch on performance of less costly methods for defining MPAs
	* mixed results
* Litte research into quantification of cost for defining MPAs to effectiveness of resulting MPA netowrks
* all else being equal, more reserves = less chance of failing to protect a critical location
* Faster, less accurate assessments result in faster results
* The longer you take to assess, the longer the species suffer
* investment in information gathering should be carefully weighed against other areas of management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Mobile Sensor Network
* Potential Forces
* Convergence is a property of the algorithm
* Model says
	* Each node has an electrostatic chagre, so do walls
	* Theres a viscous friction on the floor
		* Guarantees that nodes will evenutally settle
	* Nodes start clustered together
