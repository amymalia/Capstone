\chapter{Table of Notations}
$A$ - Bathymetry Grid - A 2D grid of real numbers that describe the depth of a section of the sea floor.  $A_{i,j}$ refers to a particular value in the cell at row i, column j.
\newline
\newline
$B$ - Behavior Grid - A 2D grid of real numbers that indicate the percentage of all transmissions that are expected to be released from that cell over the entire experiment.  $B_{i,j}$ refers to a particular value in the cell at row i, column j.
\newline
\newline
$G$ - Goodness Grid - A 2D grid with the same dimensions as the Bathymetry Grid.  Contains real numbers that indicate how good a particular cell will serve as a receiver placement.  $G_{i,j}$ refers to a particular value in the cell at row i, column j.
\newline
\newline
$ERT_{x,A,i,j}$ - Estimated Receivable Transmissions - The number of transmissions that are expected to be received from a cell at row $i$, column $j$, relative to a receiver at cell $A$, according to Evaluation Algorithm $x$.
\newline
\newline
$P_{Attenuation}(x)$ - Probability of Detection due to attenuation - Describes the probability of detecting an acoustic transmission originating at a range of x meters away from a receiver.
\newline
\newline
$Range(i,j)$ - Distance from receiver to cell at (i,j) - Distance from a particular receiver location to the cell at row i, column j.  Computed as the Euclidian distance between the center of a receiver-containing cell and the center of the cell at row i, column j on a 2D grid.

$R_{opt}$ - The number of optimal receivers to be placed by the system. (Excluding projected receivers)

$R_{proj}$ - The number of projected receivers to be placed by the system.

$D_max$

$m_{p,q}$
