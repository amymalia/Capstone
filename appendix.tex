\chapter{Table of Notations}
\noindent\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}>{\hsize=.3\hsize}X>{\hsize=1.5\hsize}X@{}}
	
	$A$ & Bathymetry Grid - A 2D Grid of real numbers that describe the depth of a section of the sea floor.  $A_{i,j}$ refers to a particular value in the cell at row i, column j.\\

	$B$ & Behavior Grid - A 2D Grid of real numbers that indicate the percentage of all transmissions that are expected to be released from that cell over the entire experiment.  $B_{i,j}$ refers to a particular value in the cell at row i, column j.\\
	
	$G$ & Goodness Grid - A 2D Grid with the same dimensions as the Bathymetry Grid.  Contains real numbers that indicate how good a particular cell will serve as a receiver placement.  $G_{i,j}$ refers to a particular value in the cell at row i, column j.\\

	$n$ & The square root of the total number of cells in the Bathymetry Grid (A).  Approximates the edge dimension of a square Bathymetry Grid.\\

	$ERT_{x,A,i,j}$ & Estimated Receivable Transmissions - The number of transmissions that are expected to be received from a cell at row $i$, column $j$, relative to a receiver at cell $A$, according to Evaluation Algorithm $x$.\\

	$P_{Attenuation}(x)$ & Probability of Detection due to attenuation - Describes the probability of detecting an acoustic transmission originating at a range of x meters away from a receiver.\\
	
	$Range(i,j)$ & Distance from receiver to cell at (i,j) - Distance from a particular receiver location to the cell at row i, column j.  Computed as the Euclidean distance between the center of a receiver-containing cell and the center of the cell at row i, column j on a 2D Grid.\\
	
	$R_{opt}$ & The number of optimal receivers to be placed by the system. (Excluding projected receivers)\\
	
	$R_{proj}$ & The number of projected receivers to be placed by the system.\\
	
	$D_max$& The deepest observable depth within a target cell, relative to the current cell. See Section~\ref{LoSAlgorithm}\\
	
	$m_{p,q}$&The slope between cells $p$ and $q$, expressed as the change in bathymetric elevation (of the sea floor) between cells $p$ and $q$, divided by the Euclidean Distance between cells $p$ and $q$. See Section~\ref{LoSAlgorithm}\\
	
	$D_{range}$ & The detection range of the receiver.  Assumed to be the same for all receivers in the network.  Given as the distance between a receiver and tag at which there is a 5\% chance of detecting an acoustic transmission.\\

	$d_{detection}$& The edge size of the Detection Area, equal to $2r+1$ cells.\\
	$f_{supp}$ & The Suppression Range Factor.  A positive real number.\\
	$r_{supp}$ & The Suppression Range. Equal to $f_{supp}*D_{range}$\\
	$d_{supp}$ & The square root of the number of cells in the Suppression Area.  The edge dimension of the Suppression Area.  Equal to $2*r_{supp} + 1$ cells.\\
