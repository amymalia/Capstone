	abstract = {Mission-critical target detection imposes stringent performance requirements for wireless sensor networks, such as high detection probabilities and low false alarm rates. Data fusion has been shown as an effective technique for improving system detection performance by enabling efficient collaboration among sensors with limited sensing capability. Due to the high cost of network deployment, it is desirable to place sensors at optimal locations to achieve maximum detection performance. However, for sensor networks employing data fusion, optimal sensor placement is a non-linear optimization problem with prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, we present fast sensor placement algorithms based on a probabilistic data fusion model. Simulation results show that our algorithms can meet the desired detection performance with a small number of sensors while achieving up to 7-fold speedup over the optimal algorithm.},

	abstract = {The recent introduction of low-cost, moored data-logging acoustic receivers has provided opportunities for tracking marine organisms over small (hundreds of metres) and large scales (hundreds of kilometres). Acoustic receivers have been deployed in many different environments to examine specific hypotheses regarding the movement of aquatic species. This technology provides many advantages for studying aquatic animal movement patterns, but also has limitations and provides unique difficulties for users. Study design, applications, advantages and limitations are discussed with examples from past and current studies. Data management and analysis techniques are in their infancy and few standardised techniques exist. Complications with data management and potential data analysis techniques are discussed. Examples from the literature are utilised wherever possible to provide useful references.},

	abstract = { We consider the problem of self-deployment of a mobile sensor network. We are interested in a deployment strategy that maximizes the area coverage of the network with the constraint that each of the nodes has at least K neighbors, where K is a user-specified parameter. We propose an algorithm based on artificial potential fields which is distributed, scalable and does not require a prior map of the environment. Simulations establish that the resulting networks have the required degree with a high probability, are well connected and achieve good coverage. We present analytical results for the coverage achievable by uniform random and symmetrically tiled network configurations and use these to evaluate the performance of our algorithm.},

@ARTICLE{Howard2002,
	abstract = {This paper considers the problem of deploying a mobile sensor network in an unknown environment. A mobile sensor network is composed of a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. Such networks are capable of self-deployment; i.e., starting from some compact initial con- figuration, the nodes in the network can spread out such that the area ‘covered’ by the network is maximized. In this paper, we present a potential-field-based approach to deployment. The fields are constructed such that each node is repelled by both obstacles and by other nodes, thereby forcing the network to spread itself throughout the environment. The approach is both distributed and scalable.},
