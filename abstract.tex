\begin{abstract}
Static Observation Networks (SONs) are often used in the biological sciences to study animal migration and habitat.  These networks are comprised of self-contained, stationary sensors that continuously listen for acoustic transmissions released by sonic tags carried by individual animals.  The transmissions released by these tags carry serial identification numbers that can be used to verify that a particular individual was near a given sensor.  Because sensors in these networks are stationary, sensor placement is critical to maximizing data recovery.  Currently, no open-source automated mechanism exists to facilitate the design of optimal sensor networks.  SON design is often governed by loose ''rules of thumb'' and ''by eye'' readings of low resolution bathymetric maps.  Moreover, there is no standardized method for evaluating the efficacy of a SON.  In this paper, we present a system which takes advantage of high-resolution bathymetric data and advanced animal modeling to provide optimal network designs.   Our system also allows for statistical analysis of existing network configurations in order to create efficacy-metrics that can be used to evaluate arbitrary network configurations.  In this paper, we discuss the mathematical and conceptual models used within this system and analyze the computational complexities of our approach.
